# Spring 101

This repository contains my personal projects and lessons for learning the Java Spring Framework. Each module focuses on different aspects of Spring, including dependency injection, JDBC, and more.

## Lessons

- **IoC Container** (`spc-01-ioc-container`)
  - Introduction to Spring's IoC container with examples on XML, annotations, and Java configuration.

- **Dependency Injection** (`spc-03-dependency-injection`)
  - Examples and exercises on different ways to implement dependency injection in Spring.
  - (This is where i found out that Spring is Way too fucking confusing and hard)

- **Pure JDBC** (`spd-01-pure-jdbc`)
  - A basic exploration of JDBC with H2 database integration.
  - (This shows how frustrating it is to write without using Spring Framework for DatabasesThis reminds me of my Java EE learning Phase at Sem 4)
